				<b>The Great Wall of China</b> is a series of fortifications made of
				stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, generally built along
				an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China to
				protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of
				the various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe.<br>
				The construction of the Great Wall began as early as the <i>7th century BC</i>,
				but
				it was during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) that the most well-known sections
				of the wall were built. The wall stretches for over <u> 13,000 miles (21,000
					kilometers)</u> across China, making it the longest wall in the world.<br>
				The Great Wall is now a <b>UNESCO</b> World Heritage Site and a popular
				tourist
				destination in China. It is considered one of the Seven Wonders of the
				Medieval World and is also commonly known as the
				"Long Wall of Ten Thousand Li" in Chinese, which roughly translates to
				" <u>long wall of 5,000 kilometers.</u>"

					<b>Chichén Itzá </b>is a Mayan archaeological site located on the
					Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. The site was a major center of Mayan
					civilization and is famous for its stunning architecture and advanced
					astronomical observations.<br>
					One of the most famous buildings at Chichén Itzá is El Castillo, also known
					as the <i> Temple of Kukulcan</i>. El Castillo is a step pyramid that was
					constructed
					around the 12th century. It stands 30 meters tall and has four staircases,
					each with 91 steps, leading up to a platform at the top. If you add up the
					steps on all four sides of the pyramid, you get a total of 365, which is
					the number of days in the Mayan calendar.<br>
					El Castillo was used for religious ceremonies, including those associated
					with the Mayan calendar and astronomical observations. Twice a year, during
					the spring and fall equinoxes, the sun casts a shadow on the pyramid that
					creates the illusion of a serpent slithering down the staircase. This
					phenomenon is known as the "equinox serpent."<br>
					El Castillo is an impressive example of Mayan engineering and is an
					important
					symbol of Mayan culture. It was designated as a <u>UNESCO</u> World
					Heritage Site
					in 1988 and is one of the most visited archaeological sites in Mexico.

						<b>Petra</b> was founded in the <u>4th centuryBCE</u> as the capital city
						of
						the Nabataean Kingdom, a trading empire that controlled important caravan
						routes in the region. The city's location at the intersection of trade
						routes made it a center of commerce and wealth.<br>
						The Nabataeans were skilled at manipulating water and built a
						sophisticated
						system of cisterns, channels, and dams to supply the city with water. This
						allowed Petra to thrive in an otherwise arid region.<br>
						<i>During the Roman Empire,</i> Petra became a thriving city with impressive
						buildings, temples, and monuments. The famous Treasury building, carved
						into
						the rock face, was likely a tomb or temple and is one of the most
						recognizable structures in Petra.<br>
						After a major earthquake in the <i> 4th century CE and the changing of trade
						routes, Petra's importance waned, and the city was eventually abandoned
						and
						forgotten. </i> It remained largely unknown to the Western world until the <u> 19th
						century</u> when it was rediscovered by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig
						Burckhardt.<br>
					<u>Today, Petra is a UNESCO World Heritage Site</u> and a popular tourist
						destination, attracting visitors from all over the world who come to
						marvel
						at its stunning rock-cut architecture and learn about its rich history.<br>
